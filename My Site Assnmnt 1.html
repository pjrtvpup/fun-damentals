			<h2>About Me</h2>

		</div>

		<p class="firsttext">
			I have been a music writer and radio DJ since 2011, and I want to improve my computer fluency to better curate and present content in more engaging ways.  
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			I studied Journalism, Gender Studies, and Philosphy at Rutgers in New Brunswick, NJ.  While there I DJ'ed and managed their community radio station <a class="link" href="http://thecore.fm/public/index.php">90.3 The Core</a> and wrote for <a class="link" href="http://www.dailytargum.com/staff/josh-kelly">The Daily Targum</a> as well as our station's blog.  I went on to contribute writing to a (now-defunct) blog called Dingus On Music, and worked for several years as a clerk at <a class="link" href="https://vvinyl.com/shop/">Vintage Vinyl</a>.

			I moved to Philadelphia near the end of 2016, and have since been a contributing writer to <a class="link" href="http://philadelphia.thedelimagazine.com/35909/new-data-lp-available-for-streaming-purchase">The Deli Magazine</a>.  I am now a DJ at <a class="link" href="http://wprb.com/playlists/dj/?id=667">WPRB 103.3 FM </a> in Princeton, while working full time as a woodworker at <a class="link" href="https://pegandawlbuilt.com/">Peg & Awl</a>.
